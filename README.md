## Debol ecommerce company approached us as a data consulting firm with the goal of developing a model that can accurately predict the price of a car based on various factors such as make, model, year, price, kms_driven, and fuel_type. This model will provide customers with a better understanding of their vehicle's worth, thus allowing them to make more informed decisions when selling their car to other customers. 

Tasks performed to build the model include:

* Data cleaning and preprocessing.
* Exploratory data analysis
* Feature engineering.
* Regression modelling techniques such as linear regression.
* Model evaluation and validation techniques such as R-squared.
